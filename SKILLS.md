# Skills Catalog

This repository stores Codex skills for local tools.

## Conventions

- One folder per tool skill.
- Each skill folder must contain a `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`).
- Keep each `SKILL.md` concise; put long operational details in `references/`.
- Add `scripts/` only for deterministic or repeated tasks.

## Skills

| Name | Use When | Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ssh-tunnel-gateway | Running, configuring, or releasing the SSH tunnel gateway server/agent tools | `./ssh-tunnel-gateway/SKILL.md` |
